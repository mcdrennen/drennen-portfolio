#### Personality Test: What Type of Season Are You? 
![What Type of Season Are You?]

Initial project idea: 
I came up with this project while I was reflecting on the season changing from winter to spring. 
I was inspired by the idea that people view themselves differently, and we may identify more with different seasons.
 
Tools I used: 
JDoodle

Challenges I faced:
The main challenge was learning how to operate Python. However, I was able to apply knowledge of Excel to help better understand the coding system. 

Other Resources: 
I used the posted lectures and youtube videos.
I collaborated with a few classmates as well, and we successfully completed the project.

Result:
I set out to achieve a personality test that matches the participants' answers with what I feel best represents a specific season. 
The improvements I would make would be to add more questions that can lead to deeper thinking and more self reflection, so that, ideally, the results would be more accurate.

Summary:
This project is a fun personality quiz that matches users to a season based on their responses. Inspired by seasonal change, it encourages self-reflection and was built using Python on JDoodle.
